                  During my primary school years, I built a strong foundation in
                  academics and character development. I learned important
                  values such as discipline, respect, and responsibility, while
                  also exploring different areas of learning. This stage helped
                  me develop curiosity in mathematics and problem-solving, which
                  later inspired my interest in technology and computer science.

                  In secondary school, I became more focused on extracurricular
                  activities and took every opportunity to explore different
                  interests. I tried many things for the first time—whether in
                  academics, sports, or school events—which helped me discover
                  my strengths and weaknesses. This period was full of new
                  experiences that taught me valuable lessons about
                  responsibility and personal growth. It was a stage where I
                  learned not only from books but also from life itself, shaping
                  my character and preparing me for the future.

                  As an undergraduate student in Software Engineering, I am
                  gaining both theoretical knowledge and practical experience in
                  programming, software development, and system design. I am
                  learning to solve real-world problems through technology,
                  applying concepts from computer science and engineering to
                  create efficient solutions. My studies helped me create
                  projects that are useful and fun for me, improve collaboration
                  and made me see how most technology works logically.
